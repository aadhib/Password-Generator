# Password-Generator
The password generator is a web-based tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords. The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, which provide a clean and intuitive interface for users to interact with.

The JavaScript code behind the password generator is responsible for generating random passwords based on user preferences. Users can specify the length of the password, as well as the types of characters to include (e.g., lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols).

The password generator uses a variety of techniques to ensure that the passwords it generates are secure. For example, it uses a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate random characters, and it ensures that each password includes a mix of different character types (e.g., uppercase and lowercase letters).

Once a password has been generated, the user can copy it to their clipboard using a simple button click. The password generator also includes an option to generate multiple passwords at once, which can be useful when creating new accounts or changing passwords on multiple sites.

Overall, the password generator provides a simple and effective way to generate strong, secure passwords that are difficult for hackers to guess or crack.
